Introduction
This front-end application is built using React and is designed to provide functionalities for managing products and orders. It includes features such as viewing product details, adding, editing, and deleting products, viewing order details, updating order status, and a calendar view for tracking orders.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) - Download and Install Node.js
Git - Download and Install Git
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd <project-directory>
Install dependencies using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
Once the installation is complete, you can start the application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Use the navigation links/buttons to explore different pages such as Products Management and Orders Management.

On the Products Management page, you can add, edit, and delete products.

On the Orders Management page, you can view order details, update order status, and delete orders.

Optionally, navigate to the Orders Calendar View to view orders on their expected delivery dates and click on a date to view all orders due for delivery on that day.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
